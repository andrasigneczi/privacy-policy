<b>We don't store your data, period.</b>

We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We don't even have a server database to store it. So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn't have anything to show him.

All we do is send push notifications when breaking events happen. Those push notifications are the same for everybody. What happens on your device stays on your device.

Whenever you want to send your data to your CRM or MailChimp or Google Docs, "it only moves when you tell it to, and over their secure connections. No middleman."
